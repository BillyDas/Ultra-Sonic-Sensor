Smart Parking System (Ultra Sonic Sensor Module + possibly LED'S (as bug testing))

•	Use a weather API to display weather and show a message "it's going to be busy today" if it's hot or "it won't be busy" if it's cold

•	a small web site in the raspberry pi  that displays the car park’s availability 

•	by adding a database into the system, you can track the usage of a car park (duration) and display it on the website as well 

•	Based on that duration, you can create a small function that calculates a ticket price for parking

•	Send that ticket to the user by an email after he gets out of the car park.
